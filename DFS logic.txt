starting at root (S)



check if current POS is word
	if so, see if current word matches
		if so return true and increment sentence position by 1

	find matching rules for current POS
		if match, check each POS in rule (ie recursive call)
		if all for this rule has matched (all POS checks in subtree have returned true) save this rule as part of answer
		if not, continue to next matching rule
	
	if no matching rules/all matching rules return false, sentence has failed
